Ive done some Patches for both Z97N-WIFI & H97N-WIFI. I have patched LPC for AppleLPC, USB to keep inside the 15 Port Restrictor in 10.11+. Native Powermanagement, USB 3 works with full speed and current. SSDT-HACK is for Simulating OS X. With all SSDT injectors this machine is fully functional with 10.11+.

Credits to RehabMan for his support on this project. 


For Native Powermanagement you will need to generate a SSDT using ssdtPRGen. ssdtPRGen can be downloaded from https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh.
